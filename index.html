                Design is more than aesthetics, it's a process of discovery. My
                approach to communication design is deeply rooted in research,
                blending insights and creativity to craft solutions that are
                both thoughtful and impactful. By understanding user behaviors,
                uncovering patterns, and analyzing context, I create designs
                that communicate effectively and resonate deeply. Every project
                begins with curiosity, evolves through exploration, and
                concludes with meaningful connections that solve problems and
                tell compelling stories.

              The Arcane Flask packaging is all about making a bold statement
              with a touch of mystery. The vibrant yellow and purple color
              scheme catches your eye instantly, symbolizing energy and
              intrigue. The compact box puts the spotlight on the Arcane
              typeface, with its unique 30:70 proportions that feel sturdy yet
              elegant—just like the flask inside. The logo stands front and
              center, with simple, clean text that doesn't distract from the
              design. Open the box, and you'll find the flask cradled in a sleek
              black insert, making the unboxing feel just as special as the
              product itself. It's packaging that feels bold, refined, and
              undeniably memorable—perfect for a brand like Arcane.

              Clove Codex is a visually engaging and culturally inspired
              cookbook that celebrates the versatility of garlic through a
              Mediterranean lens. The concept revolves around showcasing garlic
              in its various forms: raw, roasted, pickled, confit, and burnt,
              each highlighted through innovative recipes. The design integrates
              bold, playful typography with elegant serif fonts, creating a
              balance between modernity and tradition. Vibrant Mediterranean
              patterns, wave inspired motifs, and cozy illustrations bring the
              pages to life, while dynamic layouts keep the content fresh and
              immersive. The cookbook's goal is to appeal to a younger audience,
              blending culinary creativity with a rich visual narrative, making
              it as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the palate.

              This poster series, created as part of a design history project,
              reimagines three influential art movements: Neoclassicism, Rococo,
              and Post-Impressionism, through modern product design. Each poster
              is tied to a product (CD cover, postage stamp, and pizza box) and
              encapsulates the aesthetic and cultural essence of its respective
              movement. The Neoclassical poster reflects symmetry and grandeur,
              the Rococo design emphasizes opulence and whimsy, and the
              Post-Impressionist piece highlights bold expression and texture.
              This series bridges historical art traditions with contemporary
              creativity, showcasing their timeless relevance in modern visual
              storytelling.
